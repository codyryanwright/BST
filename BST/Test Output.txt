Constructing empty BST
BST is empty

Inorder Traversal of BST:

Preorder Traversal of BST:

Postorder Traversal of BST:

BST height is : 0
BST # of nodes is : 0
BST # of leaves is : 0

Now insert a bunch of integers into the BST.
Try items not in the BST and some that are in it:

Item to insert (-999 to stop): 60

BST height is : 1
BST # of nodes is : 1
BST # of leaves is : 1
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 20

BST height is : 2
BST # of nodes is : 2
BST # of leaves is : 1
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 70

BST height is : 2
BST # of nodes is : 3
BST # of leaves is : 2
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 40

BST height is : 3
BST # of nodes is : 4
BST # of leaves is : 2
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 10

BST height is : 3
BST # of nodes is : 5
BST # of leaves is : 3
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 50

BST height is : 4
BST # of nodes is : 6
BST # of leaves is : 3
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 30

BST height is : 4
BST # of nodes is : 7
BST # of leaves is : 4
Item to insert (-999 to stop): 30

  ERROR: Number Already In Tree

Now testing the contains() operation.
Try both items in the BST and some not in it:
Item to find (-999 to stop): 30
Found
Item to find (-999 to stop): 45
Not found
Item to find (-999 to stop): -999

Now testing the remove() operation.
Try both items in the BST and some not in it:

Item to remove (-999 to stop): 40
        70
 60
                50
                        30
